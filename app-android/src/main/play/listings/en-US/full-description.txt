This application adds Grand River Transit (GRT) buses information to MonTransit.

This app contains the buses schedule (available offline) and the real-time next departures from realtimemap.grt.ca as well as the latest news from www.grt.ca and @GRT_ROW on Twitter.

GRT buses serve Waterloo, Cambridge, Kitchener, St. Jacobs and Elmira in Ontario, Canada.

Once this application is installed, the MonTransit app will display buses information (schedule...).

This application only has a temporary icon: download the MonTransit app (free) in the "More ..." section bellow or by following this Google Play link https://bit.ly/MonTransitPlay

You can install this application on the SD card but it is not recommended.

The information comes from the GTFS file provided by the Region of Waterloo and Grand River Transit.
